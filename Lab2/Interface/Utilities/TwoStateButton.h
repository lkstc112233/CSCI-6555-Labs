/**
 * A button that has two states that accepts two shapes as state, manages a state bool.
 * The button is located on x, y, x + size, y + size. If the shape model is larger than this, 
 * overflowing part will be drawn but not accepting any click.
 * On click the button will trigger and the state will flip. If two buttons overlap, they will
 * both trigger.
 * 
 * A rotation can be accepted that will apply to both shapes.
